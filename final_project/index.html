            <p>The year 2021 was a landmark year for
              climate science.
              For decades, scientists have pointed to concerning trends in
              Earth's
              climate and pointed to greenhouse gases as a major threat, but
              2021
              was
              the first year that the United Nations International Panel on
              Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that human influence has

                href='https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf'>unequivocally
                warmed the
                atmosphere, ocean, and land'.</a> This type of unambiguous
              consensus
              among
              scientists is rare and the implications are serious and cascading.
              <br><br>
              When concentrations of greenhouse gases like C02 increase in our
              atmosphere, they cause temperatures to change and weather patterns
              to
              shift. This leaves the world vulnerable to things like more
              extreme
              droughts and more frequent disasters. These changes compound into
              things
              like food
              shortages, health
              crises, and housing insecurity.

              scientists agree that to avoid the most
              serious effects on our climate we need to limit the global
              temperature
              increase to at or below 1.5째C. (For context - the IPCC
              estimates that <a
                href='https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM_final.pdf'>global
                warming is likely to reach 1.5째C
                between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current
                rate</a>.')
              We have a lot of work to do.
              <br><br>
              Over the past decade scientists have called on global leaders
              repeatedly
              to make changes that will limit C02 emissions: things like
              shifting to renewable
              sources of energy, building out infrastructure that facilitates a
              shift from traditional gas-powered cars, and decreasing
              deforestation.
              <br><br>
              The responsiblity of each country is not equal though. Some
              countries
              emit far more than others and to meet the 1.5째C these
              countries need to do their part. This graphic lets you explore who
              the
              biggest emitters are and whether their promises to cut back will
              be
              enough to stay below the 1.5째C target.
